# Time Series Forecast
This repository contains various Deep Learning Architectures I implemented from scratch during my master thesis. The original dataset used within my thesis can not be shared publicly and was thus exchanged. The list below shows which architectures I implemented:

1) Encoder-Decoder with Attention (mainly following the architecture of: https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)
    - This architecture can be used to predict one- ore multi-step ahead and further to analyse to which input time-setps the model attends while predicting
2) Feature-wise Attention Network (developed myself and inspired by https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/1/1/19 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
    - This model can be used to predict one-step-ahead and further to analyse to which input features the model attends
3) Temporal-Feature-Wise Attention Network


If the architecture implemented is inspired or follows a paper I tried to at least briefly summarise the paper.
Have fun...
