# Time Series Forecast
This repository contains various Deep Learning Architectures I implemented from scratch during my Master-Thesis. The original dataset used within my thesis can not be shared publicly and was thus exchanged. The list below shows which architectures I implemented:

1) Multilayer Perceptron (Feed-Forward-Neural-Network)
2) Encoder-Decoder LSTM/GRU/RNN
3) Encoder-Decoder with Attention (mainly following the architecture of: https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)
4) ....

If the architecture implemented is inspired or follows a paper I tried to at least briefly summarise the paper.
Have fun...
